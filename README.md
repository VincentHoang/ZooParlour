## Zoo Ice Cream Parlour

- There is no main method, but you can run the tests by running `./gradlew test` in the terminal

##### Libraries used
- assertJ: for testing

##### Assumptions
- You can get a discount multiple times if enough quantity. e.g. If there were 6 Rocky Roads, then that's 2 lots of "Buy 2 get 1 Free" discounts.
- Only the function to calculating the pricing and discounts is required, therefore functions like adding and removing items were not implemented.
